# Graphical Audio Analyzer

Principles of Computer Organization course project

## Description

Human ear is not able to precisely distinguish between sound frequencies. Moreover, the perception of sound waves with too high, or vice versa, too low frequencies weakens with ages. Nowadays sound analysis has become a crucial field of IT, and with our project we contributed to its development.

Team developed a Graphical Audio Spectrum Analyzer based on STM32. It is a real-time analyzer of the sound, depicting the frequencies on the 8x8 matrix. Each column is in charge of one group of related frequencies. The more leds are lighted in the column - the louder the frequency is.

The aim of the project was to solve the above issues, by depicting the sound on the matrix' leds. Such way of visualisation is more convenient then graphs or tables, as the matrix depicts the reslts in a natural way for people to percept.
